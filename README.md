## printf
This is a project am supposed to do with my buddy **Abdelrahman sayed** thoughI dont see him anywhere which i guess I have to handle now on my own. Anyway leaving that aside, this project is about creating a printf function that imitates the actual printf command located in the stdio.h library. So fellas, lets get to it!
